        <h2>His Holiness, Pope Francis<br>
        Servant of the Servants of God</h2>

        <p>My Dear Young People,<br>
        God spoke to Abraham and said: "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.” (Gen 12.1). These words are now also addressed to you. They are words of a Father who invites you to "go”, to set out towards a future which is unknown but one which will surely lead to fulfillment, a future towards which He Himself accompanies you. I invite you to hear God's voice resounding in your heart through the breath of the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p>When God said to Abram, "Go!”, He certainly did not say to distance himself from his family or withdraw from the world. Abram received a compelling invitation, a challenge, to leave everything and go to a new land. What is this "new land” for us today, if not a more just and friendly society which you, young people, deeply desire and wish to build to the very ends of the earth?
        I would also remind you of the words that Jesus once said to the disciples who asked him: "Teacher [...] where are you staying?” He replied, "Come and see” (Jn 1:38). Jesus looks at you and invites you to go with him. Dear young people, have you noticed this look towards you? Have you heard this voice? Have you felt this urge to undertake this journey? I am sure that, despite the noise and confusion seemingly prevalent in the world, this call continues to resonate in the depths of your heart so as to open it to joy in its fullness. This will be possible to the extent that, even with professional guides, you will learn how to undertake a journey of discernment to discover God's plan in your life. Even when the journey is uncertain and you fall, God, rich in mercy, will extend his hand to pick you up.</p>

        <p>In Krakow, at the opening of the last World Youth Day, I asked you several times: "Can we change things?” And you shouted: "yes!”. That shout came from your young and youthful hearts, which do not tolerate injustice and cannot bow to a "throw-away culture” nor give in to the globalization of indifference. God encourages you to go where He sends you: "Do not be afraid, [...], because I am with you to deliver you” (Jer 1:8).</p>

        <p>A better world can be built also as a result of your efforts, your desire to change and your generosity. Do not be afraid to listen to the Spirit who proposes bold choices; do not delay when your conscience asks you to take risks in following the Master. I entrust you to Mary of Nazareth, a young person like yourselves, whom God beheld lovingly, so she might take your hand and guide you to the joy of fully and generously responding to God’s call with the words: "Here I am” (cf. Lk 1:38).</p>
