        <h2>His Eminence John Cardinal Njue<br>
        Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Nairobi</h2>

        <p>Dear young people of the Archdiocese of Nairobi,<br>
       Be witnesses to the Lord in word and in spreading the knowledge of His Name to your brothers and sisters.</p>

        <p>Jesus appointed his apostles to send them to a mission for his father. The mission of Christ is the salvation of the world. I appeal to you all young people, to be active missionaries. Do not just stay and watch things happening or simply do what others tell you but with prudence and wisdom, do good and avoid bad advice and those who would seek to misuse you. In the words of His Holiness, Pope Francis, “A better world can be built also as a result of your efforts, your desire to change and your generosity. Do not be afraid to listen to the Spirit who proposes bold choices; do not delay when your conscience asks you to take risks in following the Master.”.</p>

        <p>Through our baptism, we died with Christ, let us be witnesses of the Risen Lord in truth and in love. I therefore encourage you to take your place in the Church and contribute actively and generously to the mission of the Church with your energy and idealism, fully knowing that the Church knows that its future lies with you.</p>

        <p>And I gladly impart on all of you and your families my apostolic blessing</p>
        
        <h3>Your Shepherd,<br>
        John Cardinal Njue</h3>
