            <p>Youth For Christ (YFC), are all young people within the Archdiocese who are 18 – 26 years of age, or those who have finished high school, are 26 years and below and not married or with a child</p>
            <p>Jesus asked the apostles and Christians to make the Gospel known “Go and preach to the whole world” (28:19-20). Every baptized Christian is part of the Church and therefore has the responsibility to be missionary. The mission of Youth for Christ is to be men and women of the future, responsible and active in the social, cultural and Church environment. Taking on the mind of Christ through the Holy Spirit and the teachings of the Church, they offer original and creative solutions to the challenges in the environment. They dedicate their talents and actively participate in the youth activities, in the animation of liturgical events and support of the Church. They focus more in learning the Catechism of the Catholic Church in order to be intelligent faithful and also other topics that can help them to be global citizens.</p>
            <p>The YFC Annual Mass takes place on Palm Sunday.</p>
