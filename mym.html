                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Jesus asked the apostles and Christians to make the Gospel known “Go and preach to the whole world” (28:19-20). Every baptized Christian is part of the Church and therefore has the responsibility to be a missionary. To be missionary is simply to be a brother or a sister, a neighbor and a friend to those around us and especially those who do not know and love Christ or are far away from the Church, the body of Christ. The MYM are therefore called to learn the human values necessary to live in the 21st century and to help others to do the same. Since they are mostly in high school, they are encouraged to join YCS while in school and participate actively while they are on holiday in the activities organized for them.</p>
                
                <p>Even though all youth are invited to participate in the Palm Sunday Mass with the Local Ordinary, the MYM annual Mass shall take place on every First Saturday of December.</p>	
                
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
    
                <ul class="styledlist">

                    <li>To learn about oneself, how to live with others and how to be a good Christian and an honest citizen</li>
                    <li>To learn about oneself, how to live with others and how to be a good Christian and an honest citizen</li>

                </ul>

                    <h2>Role Models for MYM</h2>
                    <p>It is important in our journey of faith to realize that we are never alone. We have brothers and sister who have journeyed on this path before and they know how to go about it. We can and should ask for their help and support. Each parish and youth group needs to do some research and find out about the saints given here and how each person can imitate them in their own way and circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Being holy and being saints is not an invitation that is reserved to Bishops, Nuns, Brothers and Priests but it is a universal vocation. Holiness actually consists of cheerfulness, doing one’s duty with excellence, initiative and innovation, Being friends with Jesus and being of service and friendly to everyone. We all can do that! So here are teenage saints that can support us in this journey. Kindly read about them! Feel free to research about other teenage saints and allow yourself to be challenged.</p>
