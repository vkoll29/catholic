                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Jesus asked the apostles and Christians to make the Gospel known “Go and preach to the whole world” (28:19-20). Every baptized Christian is part of the Church and therefore has the responsibility to be a missionary. To be missionary is simply to be a brother or a sister, a neighbor and a friend to those around us and especially those who do not know and love Christ or are far away from the Church, the body of Christ. The MYM are therefore called to learn the human values necessary to live in the 21st century and to help others to do the same. Since they are mostly in high school, they are encouraged to join YCS while in school and participate actively while they are on holiday in the activities organized for them.</p>
                
                <p>Even though all youth are invited to participate in the Palm Sunday Mass with the Local Ordinary, the MYM annual Mass shall take place on every First Saturday of December.</p>	
                
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
    
                <ul class="styledlist">

                    <li>To participate fully in the liturgical activities of the Church and especially at the parish level</li>
                    <li>To learn about oneself, how to live with others and how to be a good Christian and an honest citizen</li>
                    <li>To learn about oneself, how to live with others and how to be a good Christian and an honest citizen</li>
                    <li>To understand the three different vocations in the Church: Marriage, Priesthood and Religious.</li>
                    <li>To know, understand and appreciate the Catholic Faith</li>
                    <li>To strengthen one’s Christian life and missionary formation</li>
                    <li>To encourage one another in caring for missionary vocations</li>
                    <li>To promote spiritual and material support for the evangelization of peoples around the world</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>Membership</h2>

                    <h2>Role Models for MYM</h2>
                    <p>It is important in our journey of faith to realize that we are never alone. We have brothers and sister who have journeyed on this path before and they know how to go about it. We can and should ask for their help and support. Each parish and youth group needs to do some research and find out about the saints given here and how each person can imitate them in their own way and circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Being holy and being saints is not an invitation that is reserved to Bishops, Nuns, Brothers and Priests but it is a universal vocation. Holiness actually consists of cheerfulness, doing one’s duty with excellence, initiative and innovation, Being friends with Jesus and being of service and friendly to everyone. We all can do that! So here are teenage saints that can support us in this journey. Kindly read about them! Feel free to research about other teenage saints and allow yourself to be challenged.</p>

                    <p>It is of paramount importance for all youth to realize that they are not part of a huge multinational NGO with the Pope as CEO and Bishops being mid-level managers or branch managers. We belong to a Church that spans through 2000 years of history with everyone having a role to play. The Church is the historical space within which Christ meets each of us, makes himself known to us, walks with us and teaches us while helping us mature in our love for him. He constantly invites us to ‘come and follow him.’ That means he is the model, way and guide. He also commands us to go and evangelize and to be aware that to follow Christ is to take up our crosses every day and follow him. It is very important to be cautious of the prosperity gospel that promises Christ without the Cross. That is fantasy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Jesus understands each of us and cares for each of us according to our identity and circumstances. He is God and God is love. The relationship that God seeks with people is called Mercy. Our response to this relationship that God seeks, our response to God’s invitation to His kingdom is what we call our Catholic Faith. Religion therefore is God’s invitation and our response and thus the relationship that develops between and among us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Jesus continues to forgive, console and help each of us and expects us to do the same. His first concern is to enter our hearts, become our friend and transform our lives to become the identity we were created to assume; sons and daughters of God. This is what we see among the Apostles. He called them to be with him and to go out on a mission to others. We are therefore called:</p>
